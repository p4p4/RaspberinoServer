# RaspberryPiServer

Use low-cost **Raspberry Pi** computers as a receiver for special commands from [Pocket Code](http://www.catrobat.org). 

The aim of this sub-project is to allow Pocket Code to control a RaspberryPi remotely in order to  enable children and novices to acquire knowledge and arouse interest in both programming and electronics. Features of the RaspberryPi can be accessed without having to write code on a RaspberryPi - all important features are accessible via special bricks within Pocket Code.
